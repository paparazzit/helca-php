					<h2>disinfection gel</h2>
					<p>In case of an epidemic outburst, dry wash your hands with disinfection gel multiple times 
						a day! The same goes if you’re traveling, or if you are in a need of bacteria and dirt free 
						hands. Or surfaces. 
					</p>
					<p>
					While killing bad germs, its cocoa emollient makes sure that your hands 
						are smooth and soft after dry wash. Plus, Helca’s gel won’t leave your hands sticky - we were 
						specifically dedicated to finding a non-sticky gel formula.
						
					</p>
					<p>
					Choose your size - 500ml, 1000ml, 3l & 5l
					</p>
					<p>Warning: Avoid contact with eyes and do not apply on open wounds and skin lesions. Keep away from fire.</p>
